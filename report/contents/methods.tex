%% This section explains how the research was performed.
% Sometimes it has a different name (e.g., ‘Experiments’), but still has
% the same purpose: to describe the methods. The section should
% allow another researcher to replicate the study (i.e., perform it
% again). This is different from obtaining the same findings). In
% psychology, this section has subsections describing participants,
% design, stimuli, procedure, and data analysis.
