Guardrails for LLMs in the medical domain have been explored in various studies.
The article by \citep{kang2024r} discusses a complex guardrail that combine learning and reasoning to ensure safe and correct outputs from LLMs.
The probability of unsafety is estimated for multiple categories based on a trained model for reasoning about safety.
In the reasoning phase the probability of unsafety is used to determine whether the output is safe or not using a weighted sum.
The reasoning approach provides an interesting perspective on how to ensure safety in LLM outputs, but it does not guarantee correctness in the medical domain.
Reasoning about safety categories did provide a significantly more effective guardrail compared to more simplistic models.
In \citep{hsu2025medplan} a more systematic approach of reasoning about medical plans is presented.
The guardrail takes the approach of SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) to generate medical plans.
This approach is more focused on the planning aspect of medical care, rather than directly addressing correctness in medication-related queries.
It is interesting to see that the approach reflects the medical practice of SOAP, which is a common method used by healthcare professionals to document patient care.
